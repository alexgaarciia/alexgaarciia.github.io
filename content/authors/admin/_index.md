## About Me

Hey, I'm Alex, nice to see you're reading this! I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and its applications in health, but my curiosity sometimes diverges way too much from reality and often drifts into intersections with quantum computing.

I graduated from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid with a BEng in Data Science and Engineering, and I am a MSc student in Machine Learning for Health. My background is in AI, data science, and (most recently) cloud technologies, and I've worked both as a researcher and in industry as an LLM engineer, helping to introduce agentic workflows.

I've worked on (very) random projects, ranging from developing RL algorithms for network source optimization to LLM-powered email automation. I enjoy building solutions that bridge technical innovation and real-world needs, especially if I can make this technology accessible to as many people as possible!

Beyond tech, I love running, climbing, yoga, and learning languages, but my most recent hobby is learning piano. I'm always curious to learn new things, tackle interesting challenges, and contribute to the scientific community.

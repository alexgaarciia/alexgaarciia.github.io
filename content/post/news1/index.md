I'm excited to share that my first research paper â€” where I am a first author â€” has been accepted for presentation at the 2024 International Conference on Optical Network Design and Modeling (ONDM). 

The paper introduces a reinforcement learning approach for routing in packet-optical networks using hybrid telemetry metrics.

### TL;DR

In this work, we present a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize routing in packet-optical networks. The algorithm learns to select the best paths by dynamically adapting to real-time measurements collected from both the optical and packet layers, such as pre-FEC bit error rate, propagation delay, and link load.

By combining these metrics into a latency-based reward system, our Q-learning agent can make routing decisions that respond to current network conditions, even when those conditions degrade. We evaluate the algorithm on two topologies, a small 8-node setup and the Tokyo Metropolitan Area Network, showing how it adapts routes based on changes in link quality.

I‚Äôm thrilled to share a personal milestone: on July 8th, I successfully defended my Bachelor‚Äôs thesis, receiving the highest possible grade (10/10) and being nominated for honours!

The increasing presence of AI in our daily lives made me question how truly accessible these technologies are, and what we can do to open them up to everyone, not just those with technical expertise.

### TL;DR

My thesis, titled ‚ÄúGenerative Agent-Based Models for Simulated Interactions: A Framework for Experiment Design‚Äù, aimed at democratizing access to Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) and generative agents in two key steps:

1. Identifying the accessibility challenges and opportunities of GABM in scientific research (published in a dedicated paper) 
2. Building an open-source, user-friendly platform that enables anyone, regardless of technical background, to design, simulate, and analyze generative agents

To bring this to life, I built the platform using Streamlit and Concordia, an agent modeling library from Google DeepMind. Users can choose an LLM, create agents, design scenarios, run experiments in three modes ‚Äî all agents, selected agents, or the most similar/different ones ‚Äî and visualize results.

I'm excited to share that our latest research paper â€” accepted on December 24th â€” will be published in the International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence (IJIMAI).

This work explores how different Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, LLaMA-2, and Wolfram-integrated versions, perform when solving math problems typically found in high school and early engineering courses.

### TL;DR

In this study, we benchmarked several LLMs on 20 mathematical problems, ranging from algebra to calculus, and compared their accuracy, reasoning steps, and overall reliability. We found that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5, especially in structured tasks, and that the integration of external tools like Wolfram slightly improves performance even further.

This work provides insights into how prompting strategies and tool-augmented LLMs can impact their ability to handle formal mathematical reasoning â€” a crucial step toward trustworthy AI in STEM education and applications.

abstract: In social sciences, researchers often face challenges when conducting large-scale experiments, particularly due to the simulations' complexity and the lack of technical expertise required to develop such frameworks. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a computational approach that simulates agents' actions and interactions to evaluate how their behaviors influence the outcomes. However, the traditional implementation of ABM can be demanding and complex. Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) offers a solution by enabling scholars to create simulations where AI-driven agents can generate complex behaviors based on underlying rules and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for designing reliable experiments using GABM, making sophisticated simulation techniques more accessible to researchers across various fields. We provide a step-by-step guide for selecting appropriate tools, designing the model, establishing experimentation protocols, and validating results.

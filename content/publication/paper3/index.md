abstract: In this article, we describe the components and procedures for building a drone ready for networking experimentation. In particular, our drone design includes multiple technologies and elements such as 4G/5G connectivity for real-time data transmission, a 360-degree camera for immersive vision and AR/VR, precise GPS for navigation, and a powerful Linux-based system with GPU for computer vision experiments and applications. Component selection and assembly techniques are included, along with software integration for a smooth, seamless operation of advanced edge applications.
